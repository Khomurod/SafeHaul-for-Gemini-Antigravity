//
// Loads the legal agreements the consent step must display.
//
// The text comes from the server, not from this bundle, because the submission
// snapshot freezes wording resolved from the same server registry. A locally
// held copy could drift from it, and we would then preserve — and bind a
// signature to — wording the driver never saw.
//
// FAILURE IS NOT SILENT
// ---------------------
// If the agreements cannot be loaded there is nothing legitimate to sign, so the
// hook reports the failure and the consent step blocks submission. Letting an
// applicant certify against agreements that never rendered would manufacture
// exactly the false evidence this work exists to prevent.
