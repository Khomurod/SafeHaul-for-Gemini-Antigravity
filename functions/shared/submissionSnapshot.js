// functions/shared/submissionSnapshot.js
//
// The immutable record of exactly what one driver saw, answered, accepted and
// signed.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A submitted application used to be a flat spread of the raw form data
// (buildApplicationDoc). Nothing recorded which questions were asked, what they
// were called, which legal wording was displayed, or which agreements the driver
// individually accepted. Consequences:
//
//   * Editing a question, a company detail or a legal clause retroactively
//     changed how a historical application read.
//   * The PDF rendered custom questions from the ANSWER map, using each key as
//     the label — and those keys are ids, which is how UUIDs reached users.
//   * The PDF stamped a signature block onto all four agreements regardless of
//     what was actually presented or accepted.
//
// A snapshot resolves the answers against the definition ONCE, at submission,
// and stores the resolved result. Later edits to settings or wording cannot
// reach it.
//
// DESIGN RULES
//   1. A field the company hid was never asked — it is not an unanswered
//      question, so it does not appear as one.
//   2. A conditional field whose condition was not met was never shown; it is
//      recorded as not presented rather than as a blank answer.
//   3. An answer to a question absent from the definition keeps `label: null`
//      and `unknownQuestion: true`. Never the id.
//   4. A signature is attached to an agreement only when that agreement carries
//      its own acceptance evidence. No evidence means no signature — never a
//      signature against wording we cannot prove was accepted.
//   5. Values are stored as truth; masking is a presentation decision made by
//      the renderer, driven by the `sensitive` flag.
